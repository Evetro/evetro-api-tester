# evetro-api-tester
An example integration against Evetro's Test API. Extends GraphiQL, but allows injection of bearer tokens in the header object.

## ToDo
* Source code for retrieving and setting the bearer token
* Source code for storing the bearer token for efficient reuse
* Source code which renders the web page and runs the node server
* "Inject" bearer token into frontend environment
* ReactJS source code with GraphiQL web app
* Provide a token the system, else it will fetch one from Auth0 using process.env and node-fetch!!
